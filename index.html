    <div style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 70%; white-space: pre-wrap;">Hello, i'm Stefan Nešić, and i am an 18 year old culinary student from Serbia.
My hobbies for the most part are cooking, programming, digital art and video games.

Cooking has been a hobby of mine for a while, my mother tells me how i've made mud cookies when i was little and how she had to pretend to eat them.
My father was a cullinary student and i hope to surpass his skill one day.
I currently attend an catering school middle school in my home town, and i hope to attend a gastronomy school when i am done with my current schooling.

I first got access to a computer when i was really young, and i quickly discovered all of the fun things you can do with it.
My childhood game was Minecraft, it is still my favorite game to this day, even though i don't enjoy the direction the game is going in nowadays.

I've only been programming since around 2018, when i downloaded a scripting language for Minecraft called Denizen Script.
I also started using JavaScript and HTML afterwards, and made some pretty basic websites.
From there, a friend recommended i try out Python, and it really stuck with me, programming with it is always easy and fun.

My digital art interest stems from Minecraft, because i've wanted to create my own content for the game so i've tried to study and duplicate its artstyle as best as i could.

I played a lot of video games, my favorites are Roguelites such as Vagante, Neo Scavenger and Slay the Spire, and story driven RPG Maker games such as LISA and Omori.
I also played a lot of grindy games such as World of Warcraft and Omori.</div>
